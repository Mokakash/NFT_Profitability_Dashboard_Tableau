# NFT_Profitability_Dashboard_Tableau

In this Tableau visualization project, I have used my personal collection of 2022 NFT trades to visually analyze my trades, exploring the most profitable trading methods, month-over-month performances, and determining where to focus my time among various alpha groups.


This Tableau dashboard seamlessly integrates interactive filtering and reactive data selection capabilities and can be toggled between day and night modes based on user preferences.

Feel free to explore and interact with the dashboard by visiting the Tableau Public link provided here.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and statistics used in this dashboard, I strongly recommend reviewing the 'NFT_Trades_Project' in my repository where I utilized Python to clean the dataset and performed an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
